# Broadlume UI Library

Welcome to the Broadlume UI library! This library implements the Willow design system as a collection of reusable components to be used across different projects in the Broadlume X ecosystem.

Each component <s>has been</s> will be meticulously designed and built to meet the needs of our various applications while ensuring consistency across different applications and platforms.

## How to use this library

To use a component from the library, simply import it in your project. Here is an example:

```js
import { Button } from 'broadlume-ui';

<Button>Hi, I'm a button</Button>;
```

We will have better examples later.

In addition, since the library isn't currently hosted on NPM, here's how you can test importing library components in your own projects:

- Clone the repo (if you're reading this right now, you've already done that).
- Run `npm link` in the root directory of this repo.
- Then, in your consuming project, run `npm link broadlume-ui` to link this library to your project.
- You will then be able to consume the library, as well as make changes & see them reflected in your project.\*

\*Note: in my experience, you will have to re-link every time you run `npm install` in your consuming project, as it removes symlinks. As far as I can tell, this is just an issue with `npm link` & I'm not sure if there's a workaround.

## Technologies

In terms of adding components, here are some technologies installed in this library you can leverage to make your dev experience better:

- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Sass
- SVGR
- Shadcn/ui
- NOT BOOTSTRAP

If any of these technologies are unfamiliar to you, it's probably fine because outside of Typescript & not using Bootstrap they're all optional (but they're dope, you should check them out).

## Design Organization

We're adopting some principles of the Atomic Design philosophy, namely by categorizing components into Atoms, Molecules, & Organisms.

One deviation from standard Atomic Design: basic utilities such as typography, colors & spacing have been exempted from this hierarchy, as they're more 'quarks' than actual atoms. As atoms should be completely independent from other atoms, it stands to reason that if typography is an atom, then buttons, labels or any other element can't be considered "atomic" since they can be affected by changing typography. So, to prevent literally everything that isn't typography or a color from being a molecule we're just considering these basics as subatomic/not necessary to categorize.

## Library File Structure

Put new components into the `src/components` directory.

It is recommended that you create a folder for the component, with a `.tsx` file for the component & a `.stories.tsx` file for the [Storybook example](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction).

It is also recommended that you use [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the component template, as the code comes with accessibility built-in & really helps to shorten the development time while remaining unopinionated. This is not mandatory, but once ShadCN 'clicks' you will have a much better time making components.

This library supports Sass as well as CSS, so feel free to use either. Using CSS/SCSS modules is highly encouraged, as doing so will prevent classname collisions as the library gets bigger & generally is a much better developer experience once you realize how much easier it is to write CSS when you don't have to namespace all your classes.

Here is an example of 3 files that could be added for NewComponent:

- src
  - NewComponent
    - NewComponent.tsx
    - NewComponent.stories.tsx
    - NewComponent.module.scss\*

\*Note that the styling is highly flexible & even optional. Some extensions you can use:

- .module.css
- .module.scss
- .scss
- .css
- No file for CSS at all, because Tailwind makes CSS unnecessary

## Contribution

We encourage contribution - but not QUITE yet. Once there's some security to merging in new code, you can make a PR & I can approve it.

#### We're officially entering the wild, wild west of a brand new, quickly scaling codebase. We're going to move fast & break things with standards established in real time, but by the end of it we'll have a Broadlume X that looks as good as the designs & works for everyone!

#### Happy coding!
