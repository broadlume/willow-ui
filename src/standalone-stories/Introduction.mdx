# Broadlume UI Library

Welcome to the Broadlume UI library! This library implements the Willow design system as a collection of reusable components to be used across different projects in the Broadlume X ecosystem.

Each component has been meticulously designed and built to meet the needs of our various applications while ensuring consistency across different applications and platforms.

## How to use this library

To install the library, you'll need to grab the private package from GitHub Packages (not npm).

This means you'll need to add a `.npmrc` file to your project (that you do NOT commit to GitHub, it has a private key) wherever your package.json file is to let npm know where to look & what credentials to use. Here's the file to copy+paste:

```bash
# .npmrc
@broadlume:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Make sure to replace YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN with your own GitHub Personal Access Token. You can find instructions on how to generate one [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

After installation, the tricky part is over! Now to use components from the library, simply import the library CSS (ideally into your `index.css`) & then import any component you want into your project. Here is an example:

Importing the CSS:

```css
/* index.css */
@import '@broadlume/willow-ui/style.css';
```

then:

```js
// App.js
import { Button } from '@broadlume/willow-ui';

<Button>Hi, I'm a button</Button>;
```

This more or less applies to every component, with the exception of Toast, which needs a provider to be added to the root of your app & to be called with a hook. I will write documentation on that later.

## Technologies

In terms of adding components, here are some technologies installed in this library you can leverage to make your dev experience better:

- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Shadcn/ui
- Sass
- SVGR
- NOT BOOTSTRAP

If any of these technologies are unfamiliar to you, it's probably fine because outside of Typescript & not using Bootstrap they're all optional (but they're dope, you should check them out).

## Library File Structure

Put new components into the `src/components` directory.

It is recommended that you create a folder for the component, with a `.tsx` file for the component & a `.stories.tsx` file for the [Storybook example](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction).

It is also recommended that you use [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the component template, as the code comes with accessibility built-in & really helps to shorten the development time while remaining unopinionated. This is not mandatory, but once ShadCN 'clicks' you will have a much better time making components.

This library supports Sass as well as CSS, so feel free to use either. Using CSS/SCSS modules is highly encouraged, as doing so will prevent classname collisions as the library gets bigger & generally is a much better developer experience once you realize how much easier it is to write CSS when you don't have to namespace all your classes.

Here is an example of 3 files that could be added for NewComponent:

- src
  - NewComponent
    - NewComponent.tsx
    - NewComponent.stories.tsx
    - NewComponent.module.scss\*

\*Note that the styling is highly flexible & even optional. Some extensions you can use:

- .module.css
- .module.scss
- .scss
- .css
- No file for CSS at all, because Tailwind makes CSS unnecessary

## Contribution

We encourage contribution.

**If you dare.**

Just kidding, it's not that bad. Here's how to contribute:

- Make a PR
- Get it approved by me

#### We're officially entering the wild, wild west of a brand new, quickly scaling codebase. We're going to move fast & break things with standards established in real time, but by the end of it we'll have a Broadlume X that looks as good as the designs & works for everyone!

#### Happy coding!
