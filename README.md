Hi, the real documentation is in the Storybook, for more info please run that.

To see the library without wrangling code, it is hosted on Chromatic: https://www.chromatic.com/library?appId=64c0d03a5f68943881b2fb3e

Click on "View Storybook" to go straight to the Storybook & skip all the UI versioning & testing stuff.

If you want to run the project locally, clone the repo!

Then, to install the dependencies of the project:
`npm i`

To run Storybook:
`npm start`

& that's it, Storybook should now be running on your computer at http://localhost:6006/. Let me know if that doesn't work for you.
