Hi, the real documentation is in the Storybook, for more info please run that.

To install the dependencies of the project:
`npm i`

To run Storybook:
`npm start`

& that's it, Storybook should now be running on your computer at http://localhost:6006/. Let me know if that doesn't work for you.

**Please don't edit anything, I don't have CI/CD set up yet thx**
