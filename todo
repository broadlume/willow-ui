- Where are types exported from, again?
- recommended extensions
- double check how to import the library
- double check if consumers must import a stylesheet
- We need CI/CD
  - For now, all PRs just need approval from me
- We need a way to distribute the library
  - npm?
- Formatting - Prettier, likely requiring a .prettierrc & .prettierignore
- A better README? Not a priority though
- Type safety for CSS modules would be nice
- what the heck is Husky
- versioning?
- maybe command-line tools for generating components
- components should have comments documenting their use for consumers
