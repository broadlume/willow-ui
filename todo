* Where are types exported from, again?
* recommended extensions
* check that the library can be imported
* double check if consumers must import a stylesheet
* We need CI/CD
  * For now, all PRs just need approval from me
* We need versioning
* We need a way to distribute the library
* Formatting - Prettier, likely requiring a .prettierrc & .prettierignore
* A README? Not a priority though
* Type safety for CSS modules would be nice
